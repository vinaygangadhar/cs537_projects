Use strtok - To split the str to tokens


Notes:

Fork():	- OS creates a copy(child) of the calling (parent) process's address space
				- Child process runs the same code as parent immediately after the fork call
				- Child process returns a 0 when it returns
				- When the aprent returns it returns the pid

				- To implement background process, parse & and make sure parent doesn't wait for child to exit and child keeps running


FD: 	- Index into OS table of open files
			- By default, when any process is created 3 automatic file descriptors [STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR]
			- Redirection -> Close the actual stdout and open a new file and the new file fd will get that location of stdout closed
			- So when printf tries to print it prints to stdout, but now the stdout(=1) is the redirected fd of the file


Built in Commands: - Once you get the command, (interactive or batch), parse the command and check following:
													- Whether the entire command exceeds 512 bytes including carriage return
													- If command has only carriage return and call arg_check again
													- check the arg[0] of command and it should match with the built-in commands, if not throw an error
													- The options also must be parsed to correctness
													- If options has char '&', then work on getting it run in background
