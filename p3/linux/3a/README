To run:
1) Navigate to the directory that contains your mem.c and Makefile (and mem.h, which should match ours)
2) Run the script "runtests" that can be found in this directory. You may
   copy it to another location if you prefer.
3) Remember that you can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more 
   testing options.

===========================
!If you are failing a test!
===========================
All of the tests for 3a are in ./tests/. You can see what we
are testing and you can debug your solution by copying our C file test,
compiling, and running (with your libmem.so) with gdb.
