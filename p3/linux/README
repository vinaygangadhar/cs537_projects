- Mem_Init to allocate an initial amount of free space - 1 time
- Maintain a free list of available regions of memory pn alloc, search the free list to find a chunk of memory to satisfy the request

Ex: 4k mem_init
	- head of the free list is at start of 4k
	- Alloc 512B 
	- Head points to next free space 
	- Keep track of remaining space (Use some global variable)


	- Each free list node will have a pointer to next free list node

	- struct __node_t {
			int size;
			struct __node_t* next;
		}
	
	- You need to incorporate all the free list of nodes of memory in mem_init function -> Embedded free list

	- Initially 
			- Head pointing to start of region
			-	First node : Size = 4k, next = NULL


	- Free (void* ptr)
			- How do you guarantee that the free ptr was allocated previously?
			- How much space is reclaimed when freed?
			- Coalesce free regions when free is called (add the freed region to free nodes)


	- Add a header structure -> keeps track of the size of allocated region and magic number(keep updating this number whenver the memory is llocated for that pointer)
			- typedef struct __header_t {
					int size; // Allocated region size
					int magic;
				} header_t;
